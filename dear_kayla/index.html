        <h1>Dear Kayla,</h1>
        <p>This is probably not what you meant by a hand-written note but here we are. On a webpage on the world wide 
            web. I thought this would be interesting and different but also meaningful and cool so I decided to do it. 
            There will be more hand-written notes to come. This all-in-all, took me less than an hour to make. Important to note, is that I did this from scratch, I'm not
            copying another website or a past project of my own. This is for you. ‚ù§
        </p>
        <p>You mean everything to me. I am so grateful to have you in my life. From the moment we met at the 
            dance until now you have just made me happy. I feel less lonely when I am with you. I feel like someone
            understands my inner feelings and cares about the way I feel. It makes me feel good when I am able to 
            do the same thing for you.
        </p>
        <p>It means a lot to me that you would think so much about our wedding and plan for it. A big part of me is
            actually very scared to do adult things and grow up. It's scary for me to get married. I am so glad you 
            are there to help me. I am sorry if I'm not always the best at diligently getting ready for our marriage. 
            I think having to wait for everything to open up is testing me big time.
        </p>
        <p>I will want to spend so much time with you, all the time. I just want to snuggle up next to you day and night 
            so I hope that you are okay with that. üòâ I will also want freedom sometimes to be alone. To play a game or 
            to hang out with other friends. I hope this is okay with you. I hope you understand that. I never want to hurt 
            you.
        </p>
        <p>Thanks for being patient with me. Thanks for believing in me and my potential. I love you a lot. I think about 
            you all the time.
        </p>
